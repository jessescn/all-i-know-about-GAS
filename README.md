# All I Know About GAS

I created this repository to centralize everything i learned and i will learn working with GAS just because i didn't found so much material when i was start working w/ GAS.

### OK, but what the he** is GAS?

GAS (Google App Script) is a scripting platform developed by Google (duh) to create light-weight applications in the G Suite platform and you don't even need to run in your own pc, all GAS scripts run in Google servers and provide a large list of native integrations with other Google services like Drive, Docs, Spreadsheets, Youtube, etc.

### But i will need to learn a new language just to work with GAS?

If you already developed web applications, probably not. You can program scripts GAS using just Javascript, HTML and CSS.


## Contributions

Please, feel free to add any relevant content about GAS that is maybe wrong or just not present in this repo. Just like i said, i'm still learning, and there's so much that i don't know, so any contribution is welcome.
